TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Security, Medical, Engineering, Human Resources, Communications, Business Systems, Logistics

DESCRIPTION: The 87<sup>th</sup> Air Base Wing is a team of mission-ready warriors and professionals delivering innovative Agile Combat Support, enabling a full range of missions across Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  Operations include maintaining security of the base, maintenance of communications infrastructure, facilities construction & maintenance, medical clinic operations, procurement, accounting, logistics, human resources, food services, community services, and media relations. The Air Force wishes to stay at the cutting edge of these various functions and technologies and is looking to partner with innovative small businesses that may have solutions to Air Force challenges.  The areas listed below are general challenge areas that the Air Force is interested in novel solutions:



1. Base Security Systems
2. Inventory Management Systems
3. Emergency Management tools & systems
4. Autonomous pickup and delivery of small parts and supplies
5. Drone detection capabilities over large areas
6. Transportation solutions:  around base & commuting to work
7. Smart City technologies

Additionally the Air Force has a number of specific challenges that require tailored solutions:



1. JBMDL has hundreds of community events each month. Most of the information is passed through emails, flyers, and separate websites/social media of each organization on base.  Interested in streamlined platform to communicate and organize this information, including gamification or other approaches to increase attendance. 
2. Most organizations have multiple legacy systems requiring users to access each of the systems to consolidate information.  Interested in ways consolidate access and inputs to these systems in a single user friendly interface.
3. A solution for members to anonymously connect to a Chaplain via an app or another medium to reduce the barriers for members to obtain spiritual guidance.
4. Organizations receive customer inputs via a pdf and manually generate multiple documents using information in the pdf.  Interested in ways to automate the creation of those documents.
5. Tools for automating data collection & visual display of executive-style dashboards.
6. Digital Path Finder
7. MEDICAL Equipment - Tracking and Accountability
8. 87 Medical Groups is interested in a capability related to patient check-in (perhaps self-check in) that can link to Aeromedical Services Information Management System (ASIMS) and our Electronic Health Records (EHR) to identify whether our Active Duty (AD) patients have individual medical readiness (IMR) requirements.  In a similar vein, a capability to identify/collect/update Third Party Collections information for our non-AD population (dependents and retirees) and automatically populate or generate the form (DD Form 2569) with the required information.  
9. Smart City technologies
10. Transportation solutions around base & commuting to work. The Air Force has a number of specific challenges that require tailored solutions: Members and dependents without privately owned vehicles are unable to access the base facilities easily, residents of base housing have trouble accessing the local areas and connecting to off base transportation methods, during peak hours (6:30 AM – 8:30 AM; 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM; 4:00PM – 6:00 PM) the gates to enter the base and housing areas have high levels of congestion.

The Air Force is interested in exploring innovative technology domains that may not be covered in the list above, so this topic is intended to also be a call for open ideas and technologies that cover other related areas not currently listed (i.e. the unknown-unknown). This topic is meant for innovative solutions to be adapted in innovative ways to meet DoD stakeholders’ needs in a short timeframe and at a low cost.
